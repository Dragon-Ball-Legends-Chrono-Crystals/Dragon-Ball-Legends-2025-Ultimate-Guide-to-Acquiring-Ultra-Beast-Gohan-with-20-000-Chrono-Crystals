### Understanding Ultra Beast Gohan and Why He’s a Game-Changer

Ultra Beast Gohan is one of the most anticipated fighters in Dragon Ball Legends 2025. His immense power, devastating abilities, and unique fighting style make him a must-have for any serious player. His signature move, the "Ultimate Beast Rush," can obliterate even the toughest opponents, making him a valuable asset to your team.

Ultra Beast Gohan is a rare unit that can only be obtained through specific banner pulls, which is where your 20,000 Chrono Crystals come in. This guide will outline the steps you need to follow to maximize your chances of pulling this powerful character.

### Step 1: Save Your Chrono Crystals and Assess the Banner

The first and most important step in acquiring Ultra Beast Gohan is saving your Chrono Crystals for the right moment. There are often multiple banners running simultaneously in Dragon Ball Legends, and not all of them feature Ultra Beast Gohan. Ensure that you’re targeting the specific banner that includes this highly sought-after fighter. Check the in-game announcements for the current banner featuring Ultra Beast Gohan, and confirm it’s available before spending your Chrono Crystals.

### Step 2: Participate in Events and Daily Missions to Earn Chrono Crystals

To ensure you have enough Chrono Crystals for your summons, participate in daily missions, events, and other special promotions. Dragon Ball Legends frequently hosts events that reward players with Chrono Crystals for completing specific objectives. By engaging in these activities, you can build up your stockpile of Chrono Crystals and increase your chances of getting Ultra Beast Gohan.

### Step 3: Maximizing Your Summons

Once you’ve accumulated your 20,000 Chrono Crystals, it's time to use them for summons. Be strategic when making your pulls. Use multi-summons to get the best value for your Chrono Crystals. These multi-summons increase the chances of pulling higher-tier fighters, including Ultra Beast Gohan.

Additionally, keep an eye on the *Guaranteed Sparking* rates. Many banners feature a guaranteed sparking unit after a certain number of summons. If Ultra Beast Gohan is included in the banner’s sparking units, this increases your odds of obtaining him.

### Step 4: Consider Using the Z Power and Exchange Shop

If you’ve already pulled some copies of Ultra Beast Gohan but need to strengthen him further, don’t forget about Z Power. Z Power can be used to level up Gohan’s star rating and improve his abilities. You can earn Z Power through the Exchange Shop, events, and missions. Keep an eye on these opportunities to maximize the potential of Ultra Beast Gohan once you obtain him.

### Step 5: Keep Track of Upcoming Promotions and Offers

Dragon Ball Legends frequently offers limited-time promotions, discounts, and additional Chrono Crystal rewards for players who log in or participate in specific events. Make sure you’re staying up-to-date on these offers to maximize your chances of pulling Ultra Beast Gohan. You might get extra rewards or discounts that will make your summons more cost-effective.

### Conclusion

With the 20,000 Chrono Crystals in your account from the limited-time free offer, you are in an excellent position to summon Ultra Beast Gohan. Follow these tips and strategies to increase your chances of pulling him, and remember to stay updated on the game’s events and banners. Good luck, and may your summons be filled with power!
